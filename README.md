Feature selection with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

## Swarm Optimization Algorithm: An Overview.
> Swarm Optimization Algorithm is a type of computational algorithm inspired by the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems found in nature, such as bird flocks, fish schools, and insect colonies. The most common forms of swarm optimization algorithms include `Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)` and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):
> 1. <u>Inspiration:</u> Derived from the social behavior of `birds flocking` or `fish schooling`.
2. <u>Mechanism:</u> Uses a population of candidate solutions called `particles`. Each particle moves through the solution space influenced by `its own best-known position` and the `best-known positions of other particles` in the swarm.
3. <u>Objective:</u> Find the optimal solution by **iteratively improving candidate solutions** with regard to a given measure of quality or fitness.

### How It Works: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
> 1. <u>Initialization:</u> Initialize a population of particles with **random positions** and **velocities** in the solution space.
2. <u>Evaluation:</u> Evaluate the fitness of each particle according to the objective function.
3. <u>Update Velocities and Positions:</u>
Each particle updates its velocity based on three factors:
  * *Inertia:* The particle's previous velocity.
  * *Personal Best:* The distance to the particle's best-known position.
  * *Global Best:* The distance to the swarm's best-known position.<br>
Update the particleâ€™s position by **adding its new velocity to its current position**.
4. <u>Iteration:</u> Repeat the evaluation and update steps until a termination criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness level).

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection:
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can be adapted for feature selection in a tabular dataset. Feature selection aims to choose a subset of relevant features for model building, which can improve the performance and interpretability of a machine learning model.

## Feature selection with (PSO) step-by-step:
1. Define the Problem and Objective Function
>The objective function could be the performance metric of a machine learning model (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) using a subset of features.
2. Encode Particles
> Each particle represents a subset of features. This can be encoded as a binary vector where 1 means the feature is selected and 0 means it is not.
3. Initialize Particles
> Initialize particle positions (binary vectors) and velocities (continuous values).
4. Evaluate Fitness
> Evaluate the fitness of each particle by training and validating a machine learning model using the selected features.
5. Update Velocities and Positions
> Update velocities and positions using PSO equations. Use a sigmoid function to convert continuous velocities into binary positions.
6. Update Personal and Global Bests
> Update the personal best positions and the global best position based on the fitness evaluations.
7. Iterate
> Repeat the update steps until the stopping criterion is met.
8. Return the Best Feature Subset
> Return the best feature subset found during the iterations.
